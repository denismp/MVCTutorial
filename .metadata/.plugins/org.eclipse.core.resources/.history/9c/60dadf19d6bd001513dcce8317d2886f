I created a Spring MVC Project.

I whacked the home.jsp and the HomeController.java
that comes with the project setup.

I then mixed in stuff from the web page
http://scottsdigitalcommunity.blogspot.com/2013/05/developing-spring-mvc-project-using.html

I used the domain name, com.spring.mvc, the same as the above web page.

I added META-INF/persistence.xml

Look for my hacks
	Adding to default - don@hautsch.com
in
	pom.xml
	servlet-context.xml

The other files
	users.jsp
	User.java
	UserController.java
	UserRepository.java
are from the web page - don@hautsch.com
